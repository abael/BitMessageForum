* You can now access threads with blank subjects.  Previously there
  wasn't a visible link to click on.  (Github Issue #2)

* You can add and delete subscriptions from the new subscriptions page.
  (Github Issue #26)

* We now show help/description text on Settings page.

* We now allow sanitized HTML in messages.  No scripts and only local
  images with <img src='data:...'>.  The new setting
  'allow_sanitized_html' defaults to yes.  Existing users will need to
  update this setting if they want to view html.  (Github Issue #11)
