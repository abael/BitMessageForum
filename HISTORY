* Markdown formatting.  After enabling html display, if a message
  starts with '# Content-Type: text/markdown' then we will display
  sanitized formatted html instead.  (Github Issue #38)

* Optional https and optional http basic authentication for safe(r)
  remote access.  (Github Isuse #29)

* Made site look good with Bootstrap (medoix) (Github Issue #4)

* When PyBitmessage supports getAllXMessageIds, we do a two-pass
  message collection that only grabs a full message if it's new, and
  grabs the full messages one-at-a-time, to lighten the load on system
  resources when you have a large inbox and/or large messages.

* We now Highlight folders with new messages in the sidebar.

* Thread-safe alerter so we can send alerts from background jobs to
  main thread and eventually the user.  (Github Issue #35)

* We send messages in a background thread so the app doesn't hang.
  (Github Issue #34)

* We now provide friendly warnings if your bundle is out of date.
  (Github Issue #33)

* We now prepend "Re: " to replies to be consistent with PyBitmessage.

* You can now access threads with blank subjects.  Previously there
  wasn't a visible link to click on.  (Github Issue #2)

* You can add, delete, and list subscriptions from the new
  subscriptions page.  (Github Issue #26)

* We now show help/description text on Settings page.

* We now allow sanitized HTML in messages.  No scripts and only local
  images with <img src='data:...'>.  The new setting
  'allow_sanitized_html' defaults to yes.  Existing users will need to
  update this setting if they want to view html.  (Github Issue #11)
