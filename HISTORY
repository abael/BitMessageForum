* Verify address in compose window before sending message to API.  #60.

* Store subscriptions in AddressStore and link on subscription page.

* Added an address book page.  Requires listAddressbook API support.

* Added /json/search_addresses/?search_string=foo to support #19.

* If your API supports listAddressbook, we'll map address book entries 
  to human-readible names where appropriate.

* "Mark all messages read" button on settings page.  (Github issue #58)

* Enable spellchecking on message compose.

* Mark all threads as read on initial install so user doesn't have to.
  (Github issue #47)

* Replaced blank subjects with (No Subject) in threads and messages. (Github issue #54)

* Run bulk delete in background thread.  It can take some time.
  (Github issue #37)

* Better inline html detection to eliminate false positives.  (Github
  issue #55)

* You can now send a message to multiple recipients by separating the
  addresses with semi-colons.  (Github issue #40)

* We now hash subject lines when recording last accessed time so the
  subject text isn't readible.  This will cause existing users to lose
  their view history.  (Github issue #48)

* We don't care if sent messages are new or not.  (Github issue #52)

* Fixed issue where unicode in subject prevented us from saving the
  new thread status properly.  (Github Issue #51)

==================

* SECURITY ISSUE: Binary installs ran on all all network interfaces.

0.2.1 - 2013-08-04

  builds.

0.2.0 - 2013-08-04
==================

* Configuration files have been moved to $HOME/.bitmessageforum so a
  system-installed bmf gem will be able to write changes.  Existing
  users may wish to copy thier files from BitMessageForum/config to
  keep their settings.

* Ajax'y alert when you have new mail.  (Github issue #13)

* Markdown formatting.  After enabling html display, if a message
  starts with '# Content-Type: text/markdown' then we will display
  sanitized formatted html instead.  (Github Issue #38)

* Optional https and optional http basic authentication for safe(r)
  remote access.  (Github Isuse #29)

* Made site look good with Bootstrap (medoix) (Github Issue #4)

* When PyBitmessage supports getAllXMessageIds, we do a two-pass
  message collection that only grabs a full message if it's new, and
  grabs the full messages one-at-a-time, to lighten the load on system
  resources when you have a large inbox and/or large messages.

* We now Highlight folders with new messages in the sidebar.

* Thread-safe alerter so we can send alerts from background jobs to
  main thread and eventually the user.  (Github Issue #35)

  (Github Issue #34)

* We now provide friendly warnings if your bundle is out of date.
  (Github Issue #33)

* We now prepend "Re: " to replies to be consistent with PyBitmessage.

* You can now access threads with blank subjects.  Previously there
  wasn't a visible link to click on.  (Github Issue #2)

* You can add, delete, and list subscriptions from the new
  subscriptions page.  (Github Issue #26)

* We now show help/description text on Settings page.

* We now allow sanitized HTML in messages.  No scripts and only local
  images with <img src='data:...'>.  The new setting
  'allow_sanitized_html' defaults to yes.  Existing users will need to
  update this setting if they want to view html.  (Github Issue #11)
