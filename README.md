BitMessageForum
===============

BitMessageForum allows you to browse and post bitmessages in a
forum-like view in the web browser of your choice.

First official Alpha release is pegged for August 1st, 2013.  If
you've somehow managed to stumble on this repository before then,
please wait before trying the software and/or opening any issues.

However, if you must:

    cd BitMessageForum
    bundle install
    shotgun sinatra_server.rb
